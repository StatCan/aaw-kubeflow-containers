/* This config file contains user specific configuration options which
   override the installation default values. This file is left intact during
   the installation process so modifications to this file will remain after
   SAS Service Pack upgrades to the SAS system.

   However the default config file, sasv9.cfg, does get generated during
   SAS Service Pack upgrades to the SAS system therefore any user
   modifications made there will be overwritten in the upgrade process.

   After applying a SAS Service Pack, you should compare the backed up version
   of the configuration file with the newly generated version.  You are
   encouraged to copy any configuration changes you wish to keep to this file
   instead of sasv9.cfg so that they may be retained after the installation
   of further SAS Service Packs.
