The default Jupyter view is controlled with the ENV variable

```bash
DEFAULT_JUPYTER_URL=/tree
```


Which could be `tree`, `lab`, `rstudio`, etc.

The Git repo which gets cloned is configured by

```bash
GIT_EXAMPLE_NOTEBOOKS=https://github.com/statcan/aaw-contrib-r-notebooks
```

**It is assumed that these are set.**
