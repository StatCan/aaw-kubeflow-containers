This JupyterLab instance comes pre-installed with a few helpful extensions such as a the [jupyterlab-toc](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-toc), [jupyterlab-git](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git), and [juptyterlab-tensorboard](https://github.com/chaoleili/jupyterlab_tensorboard).\n",

To make this process as smooth as possible, we have integrated a custom-made Jupyter extension specialized on pushing single notebooks, a full-fledged web-based Git client ([ungit](https://github.com/FredrikNoren/ungit)), a tool to open and edit plain text documents (e.g., `.py`, `.md`) as notebooks ([jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)), as well as a notebook merging tool ([nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime)). Additionally, JupyterLab and VS Code also provide GUI-based Git clients.\n",

    "#### Diffing and Merging Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are great, but they often are huge files, with a very specific JSON file format. To enable seamless diffing and merging via Git this workspace is pre-installed with [nbdime](https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime). Nbdime understands the structure of notebook documents and, therefore, automatically makes intelligent decisions when diffing and merging notebooks. In the case you have merge conflicts, nbdime will make sure that the notebook is still readable by Jupyter, as shown below:\n",

    "Furthermore, the workspace comes pre-installed with [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext), a Jupyter plugin that reads and writes notebooks as plain text files. This allows you to open, edit, and run scripts or markdown files (e.g., `.py`, `.md`) as notebooks within Jupyter. In the following screenshot, we have opened a markdown file via Jupyter:\n",

    "\n",
    "In combination with Git, jupytext enables a clear diff history and easy merging of version conflicts. With both of those tools, collaborating on Jupyter notebooks with Git becomes straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "The workspace has a feature to share any file or folder with anyone via a token-protected link. To share data via a link, select any file or folder from the Jupyter directory tree and click on the share button as shown in the following screenshot:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is possible to securely access any workspace internal port by selecting `Open Tool -> Access Port`.

You can easily set up a secure and passwordless SSH connection to a workspace by selecting `Open Tool -> SSH`. This will generate a secure setup command that can be run on any Linux or Mac machine to configure a passwordless & secure SSH connection to the workspace. Alternatively, you can also download the setup script and run it (instead of using the command).\n",

    "After the tunnel is established, you can use your favorite VNC viewer on your local machine and connect to `vnc://localhost:5000` (default password: `vncpassword`). To make the tunnel connection more resistant and reliable, we recommend to use [autossh](https://www.harding.motd.ca/autossh/) to automatically restart SSH tunnels in the case that the connection dies:\n",
