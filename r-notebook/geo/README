# R + py + jl 
The datascience notebook offers R, Python, and Julia, but it's mostly focussed on R to keep the image small.

The thought is that people will often use python for little preprocessing scripts or webscraping, even 
if they aren't using it for their actual analysis.

# Stan
The image alos contains "Stan" which is a stats language that Ken requested on our team, as it's what
a piece of modeling software was written in.
